# AsteroidRush
A short game I made at WPI Frontiers 2016 over the course of about one and a half weeks.  Nothing serious, just a silly little diversion from your everyday life.

#How to Play
Start the game by pressing spacebar. Control the ship with the arrow keys, making sure to dodge the falling asteroids! Stay alive as long as possible in order to raise your score.

If you are good enough, you might make it on the high score list! Type in your name to save your glory for all of eternity (or until someone bumps you off the list).

#Notes
This game runs using cgi, so it will only work on a functioning web server. I plan to upload it to my web server next time I have a chance.
